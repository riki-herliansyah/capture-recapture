Appendix Codes (Herliansyah et al., 2021)
=========================================


The following codes are appendix codes used for model fitting on closed and open population models from the paper:

1. "AppendixB" is the main code used for performing the simulation studies and examples. 

2. "sim_closed" is the code used to simulate the closed population model (Mh-type model).

3. "sim_open" is the code used to generate dataset for the time-varying continuous-covariate CJS model.

4. "mtbh" is the function created by authors to fit Mh-type model with a few options such as method, model.

5. "CJSc" is the function for fitting the CJS model. 

6. The folder "C++" contains all C++ codes for both closed and open population models. Users are required to install TMB properly including Rtools in order to be able to run all the codes.

To install TMB, see https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp#install-the-development-version-linux.
