The following codes are appendix codes used for model fitting on closed and open population models from the paper (Herliansyah et. al., 2021).
"AppendixB" is the main code used for performing the simulation studies and examples. 
"sim_closed" is the code used to simulate the closed population model (Mh-type model)
"sim_open" is the code used to generate dataset for the time-varying continuous-covariate CJS model.
